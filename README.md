Toward developing a PV power forecasting solution, an acquisition campaign was carried out in the International University of Rabat starting from July 2018. During it, we focused on collecting weather and in-situ sky imagery data via a weather station installed in the roof of the Tech-Center building of the university. 
The weather station contains a fish-eye IP camera for sky images, a pyranometer for GHIs, a barometer for atmospheric pressure, a wind sentry set for wind speed and direction, a temperature and relative humidity sensor, and a rain gauge for precipitation.
The collected dataset is now provided publically, in CSV file format, to help the scientific community on implementing and testing prediction and forecasting techniques.
